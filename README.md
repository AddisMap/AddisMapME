## Features

AddisMapME is based on the great MAPS.ME application and published by [BAME PLC](http://bandira.map.et/)

Compared to MAPS.ME, AddisMapME strictly focuses on the Ethiopian market. We bundle more than 20.000 additional Points of Interest (POIs) the published app, whose collection was financed by BAME PLC.

BAME PLC is also one of the biggest contributors to the OpenStreetMap projects in Ethiopia.

### Adopt a POI

Users of the app can choose to improve both, POIs that are already in OpenStreetMap as well as those additional Points of Interest. When doing so, the POI is automatically donated to the OpenStreetMap project.
